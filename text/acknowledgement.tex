\chapter*{Acknowledgments}
Firstly, I would like to express my sincere gratitude to my advisor Prof. Alessandro Sperduti for the continuous support of my Ph.D study, for his patience, motivation and enthusiasm.


Besides my advisor, I would like to thank the rest of my thesis committee for their insightful and valuable comments and suggestions.


I would like to thank Dr. Alberto Testolin for all his help and for his guidance before and during my Ph.D studies.  Also, I would like to thank Prof. Peter Tino for the meaningful discussions and inputs he provided during my visit to University of Birmingham.


I would like to thank all my friends, colleagues and officemates (Moreno, Riccardo, Alberto, Daniele, Hossein and Ding Ding) here at the University of Padua for the stimulating discussions, and for all the fun we have had in the last three years.


Last but not the least, a huge thank goes to my family, that always supported me in these years. Words cannot express how grateful I am to my mother, and father for all of the sacrifices that they have made on my behalf.
